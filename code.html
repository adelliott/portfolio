     <h2>SpaceX</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          SpaceX Dragon was an individual project I was assigned in a internet technology course. The longterm goal of this project was to develop a website with the skills I have learned from the course so far. While developing this site, my knowledge of image optimization, content structuring, and styling capablilites were tested. 
        </p><br><br>
        <p>This site was comepleted approximately on February 26, 2019. In terms of takeaways, or things I learned from developing this site, I learned that using an image gallery plug-in is a much more effecient option than coding from scratch. I desired to have a scrolling image gallery on the site, and I mangaged to make it happen using CSS keyframes, however, I later discovered that using a plug in would have provided the same result and would have required much less development time, which could have been put to use in other areas of the site. Overall, I was pleased with the outcome of the site.</p> <a href="webexamples/spacex/index.html" target="_blank"><p><b>Please click here to view the site.<p></b></a>

      <h2>The Saucy Pie</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
       The Saucy Pie was a team project I was assigned in the same internet technology course. The longterm goal of this project was to develop a website with the skills I have learned from the course so far, while also collaborating with my classmates to build a site that was both pleasing to the eye and meet the requirements of our clients.

      <h2>The Boys and Girls Club of Central Arkansas</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
       The Boys and Girls Club of Central Arkansas was also a team project I was assigned in the course. For this project my team and I were tasked with developing a new site for the organization. The project outcomes included addressing functionality issues (there was a flicker in the navigation bar when it was hovered, outdated theme (the design felt a little plain), and also to improve the layout of the content.
