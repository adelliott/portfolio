This is a reflection on the student project I completed this semester. I enjoyed working on this project very much. I came into the project with a couple fears. One being that I wonâ€™t be skilled enough to finish the project and contribute to the group and the second was delivering the project and meeting the needs of the client. By the end of the project I realized that I had nothing to worry about. The results of the project were not as outstanding as I had hoped for ( there were a few unfinished areas ) but I was still very proud of the work my team and I put into it. Speaking of my team, I could not have asked for a better group of people to develop a website with. Melody, Jeremy, and Anabella were all very motivated, driven, and positive throughout the entire process which made things much less stressful.  Each of them are very talented and I hope that I can work with them again in the future.
A couple things I learned from this experience and I plan to carry over with me to future projects include: the importance of responsiveness and communication. While developing this site a notice that I did not start thinking about how things would appear on screens of different sizes until the very last stages of development and it really came back to bite me. I will definitely have to spend building my skills and knowledge on responsiveness. As for communication, building a website on your own versus working with a team is very different. When designing/developing on my own I did not have to check in with anyone when I wanted to make changes. However, when working with my team I had to train myself to let my team in on what I was doing even with the smallest of changes. This is a good practice because it keeps everyone on the same page and keeps down confusion.
