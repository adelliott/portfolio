Greetings Mr. Smith,

I hope you are well. My name is Ashari Elliott and I am the project leader of the UALR development team that will develop your website for the Boys and Girls Club of Central Arkansas. We would like to arrange a time to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss your website. If at all possible we would like to hold the first meeting on August 27th, 2019 at 1:30 PM in room 635 of the EIT building. A parking pass will be provided to you and a member of our team will escort you to the building. If you have any concerns about the meeting time please feel free to contact me. We look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you,

Ashari Elliott
