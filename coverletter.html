        <p>A synopsis of my skills:</p>

        <p><b>Wordpress.</b>
        Recently I have worked with a team to develop a website for a local non-profit. During this experience, I have learned to import and customize themes, add custom code, and utilize widgets and plugins.</p> 

        <p><b>Digital Design.</b>
        I am skilled with digital design software, such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Indesign, Adobe XD, and Gravit. Using these services, I am capable of developing website prototypes that serve as a model for developing sites. I also have much experience with vector graphics where I have created designs for bookmarks, posters, logos, and illustrations.</p> 

         <p><b>My experience with photo editing software,</b>
         such as Adobe PhotoShop means that I am capable of optimizing, restoring, and increasing the quality of images.</p>

        <p><b>Web Design and Development.</b>
        My understanding of color theory and design principles means that I can produce very modern and appealing site layouts with an appropriate use of color, fonts, and structure. I also have a proficient understanding of HTML and CSS with also a base-level understanding of JavaScript.</p> 

        <p><b>I have an optimal set of computer skills,</b>
        which include Microsoft Word/Google Docs, Google Sheets/Excel and PowerPoint. Not only am I capable of using Content Management Systems to develop sites, but I also have experience working with several text editors, including Brackets, SublimeText, and Adobe DreamWeaver.</p> 

        <p><b>Personal Skills.</b>  
        I am an active listener who has a strong work ethic. I am very determined; My primary objective is to provide users with a breathtaking and unique online experience and I hope to have a chance to prove my dedication to the industry. I am very comfortable working as part of a team to accomplish a common goal, so I will enjoy working with colleagues, clients, and other production professionals to find solutions to problems. Lastly, I am self-motivated, optimistic, and punctual. I am eager to complete tasks in a timely matter.</p>
